# Messing-Around-with-Tableau
So I recently decided to try out Tableau. It felt like a more organized version of Excel and is fairly simple to use surprisingly. I tested it out on some old data sets: the Twitch data set and the NFL Defense data set. Though I still prefer using R to make a highly detailed graph, I think I might just warm up to this neat little visualization tool and will continue to practice it. So I'll just upload the exported pictures of the graphs I have created to this folder as well as to the respective folders of previously mentioned data sets. I'll continue to learn it although I'm getting the hang of it pretty fast I'd say.
